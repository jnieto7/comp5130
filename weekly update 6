This week I updated my GUI for the capture utility to have a button that adds in additonal servers to capture on. The function
still must be implemented via javascript; it has to dynamically generate more HTML for the user upon click. This will also
provide a button to remove anything the user had added and does not wish to have in the capture. I have begun to implement
this function, however I struggled with getting it to work correctly. I found some examples online but could not get the
button to generate the HTML when I clicked on it. I think there is something wrong with my syntax. I will have to debug through this
and figure it out. Once this portion is completed, this will give the user the ability to configure the capture to multiple hosts.
The next step is to parse out the configuration that the user has provided and execute the catpures.
