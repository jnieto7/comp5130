This week I completed the following on my project:

I implemented minor adjustments to the GUI to make the look nicer for the user. For example, I have bolded and resized some of the headings so that they stand out. This makes that section of the page clear.

I fixed incrementing the ids of the "Add server" button. This button may end up going away.
Deleted some options that do not make sense for this application, and collapsed the host options.

I researched the following this week:

I did some research into java servlets. I found that it should be possible to handle an Ajax request from a client in a Java Servlet application. My intent will be to have the application extecute ssh commands to remote hosts to run the tcpdumps. WHen they complete, a response will be sent back. On stack overflow I found some sample code that shows how a request may be dispatched to a server:

"
You can put your static html (or dynamic JSPs) under WEB-INF (or WEB-INF/html below), and then use RequestDispatcher.include(ServletRequest, ServletResponse) (or forward). Something like,

RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("/WEB-INF/html/myfile.html");
rd.include(request, response);
"

I began to implement a test Java servlet and successfully was able to process a form using a servlet using javascript and jquery.
