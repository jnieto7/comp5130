This week I was able to get the javascript funtcion for adding additional servers onto my GUI working. 
This consists of a button that says "add server" that the user can click on to add a host to the protocol capture.
The functionality of the button and the parsing still needs to be written. I also added a table of selectable command
line options for the capture. I have not yet decided whether the capture options will be the same for all hosts or if the
user will be able to provide different paramaters for each host. Other than the names of the interfaces that hosts have to capture
on, in most applications of this tool it is sufficient for the caputure options to be the same for all hosts. I implemented this
using a table with checkboxes that the user can pick from. I have decided to omit a couple of options that may not make sense
for this tool. As of right now, they are commented out.

The next step is to finish all of the selectable options that users can pick, and then begin to write the parser to parse the submission.
Once the functionaluty of the project is working, I will incorporate more CSS and stlying to make the look and feel more appealing.
