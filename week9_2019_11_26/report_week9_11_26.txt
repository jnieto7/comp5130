This week I completed the following on my project:

- Created style.css style sheet for the look and feel of my GUI.  This will be the base formatting file for the project.
- Updted gui.html to use the style.css style sheet. I organized the main body of the command options into a class so they can
be formatted together. 
- I updated the gui.html to remove the options that display information to the screen because they are not useful.
  All protocol captures will be saved to files for analysis, so these options would be irrelevant.
  
  The next steps on the project:
  
The next problem to tackle is how exactly to deal with the user input to the HTML forms. I Researched input processing with Javascript. My next step is to get the input processing working so I will be thinking about Java, pure javascript or some other way to deal with the user input. Ultimately it will need to invoke Linux shell commands on remote hosts. 

One way I have thought of tackling this problem us to use a Java Servlet with an Apache Tomcat Server. This could handle the requests and in turn provide a response. This may need to be done using Ajax requests, and since I am unfamiliar with Ajax I have some learnig and reading to do about how this can be achieved.
