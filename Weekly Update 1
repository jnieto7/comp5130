Project Ideas Explored:
1. One idea that I had for my project is to make a TCPdump user interface utility. This would include a web
application that would be able to perform a tcp dump on a target host with the options provided in the utility.
This idea was motivated by my current occupation at a telecommunications company as a Software Engineer, 
where there are many times I must run tcpdump to capture packets being exchanged between hosts and copy the files over to 
my machine for analysis. This solution would make my job easier by invoking the command with the options
specified in the web interface and copying the pcap file over for me. 

2. Web workout tracker for weight lifting with backing database storage.
...more to come on this idea.
