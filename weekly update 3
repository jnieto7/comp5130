I have began to stub out what I think will be a basic web page for the GUI of the project proposed last week. I am using a 
combination of W3Schools and other online tutorials in order to learn HTML5/CSS/Javascript because most of it is new for me
I have been exposed to HTML and XML but do not know the details of Javascript. I am considering ordering a book as a guide and
reference for coding in javascript; I think it will make it easier to implement and learn it. I also am intersted in writing
secure code, because I know that javascript can be exploited for vulnerablilities. As a nice to have goal that I hope to achieve
for my project, I want my application to be resistant to javascript vulnerabilities.

This week I found an interesing article on writing secure code using javascript and various web technologies. I am alreasy aware and
familiar with some of the attacks described, just not all the details. At the end of the atricle they provide some free
tutorials to walk through about writing secure web code. Here is the link to the atricle:
