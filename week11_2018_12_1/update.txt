This week I had finished up the Servlet functionality of processing the requests. I was able to use The JSch library on the Java Servlet
in order to ssh into the remote VMs and execute the tcpdump captures.



Challenges:

I had a challenge getting my request to work with the post method. I am using Ajax in order to interact with the Servlet and update
the HTML that the user sees. I could not figure out how to successfuly pass the paramaters over to the Servlet with the post method.
As a result, I ended up using the get method. Unfortunately this presents a security concern because the passwords for the remote hosts
are sent in the URL in the request. However, because the applications for this project is for private use at work, it may be okay.
